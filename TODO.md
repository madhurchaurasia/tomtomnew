## Status: âœ… COMPLETED - Ready for Testing

## Next Steps for Developer:
1. Replace "YOUR_TOMTOM_API_KEY_HERE" with actual TomTom API key
2. Build and test the application
3. Verify GPS functionality on physical device
4. Test with real NextBillion API responses
5. Customize colors and navigation settings as needed
